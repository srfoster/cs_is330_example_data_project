# Course Catalog Scraping Toolkit

This toolkit provides multiple approaches for scraping dynamic course catalog websites, specifically designed for CTCLink systems used by community and technical colleges.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Run the analysis first:**
   ```bash
   python analyze_catalog.py
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   setup_scraper.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
   ./setup_scraper.sh
   ```

3. **Run the scraper:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Selenium (most compatible)
   python course_catalog_scraper.py
   
   # Option 2: Playwright (faster, modern)
   python course_catalog_scraper_playwright.py
   ```

## üìÅ Files Overview

### Core Scrapers
- **`course_catalog_scraper.py`** - Main Selenium-based scraper
- **`course_catalog_scraper_playwright.py`** - Modern Playwright-based scraper
- **`analyze_catalog.py`** - Pre-scraping analysis tool (no dependencies)

### Setup Files
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python package dependencies
- **`setup_scraper.bat`** - Windows setup script
- **`setup_scraper.sh`** - Linux/Mac setup script

## üîç Approach Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|------|----------|------|------|
| **Selenium** | CTCLink, PeopleSoft systems | Very compatible, handles complex JS | Slower, needs Chrome |
| **Playwright** | Modern SPAs, fast scraping | Fast, modern, good debugging | Less compatible with old systems |
| **Analysis Tool** | Understanding site structure | No dependencies, quick insights | Limited to static analysis |

## üõ†Ô∏è Scraping Strategy for CTCLink

Based on analysis of CTCLink systems, the recommended approach:

### 1. **Pre-Analysis Phase**
```python
# Run analyze_catalog.py first to understand:
python analyze_catalog.py
```
- Identifies JavaScript frameworks
- Finds iframes and forms
- Locates potential API endpoints
- Recommends best scraping approach

### 2. **Main Scraping Phase**
```python
# For CTCLink systems, use Selenium:
scraper = CourseScraperCTCLink(headless=False)  # Set True for production
success = scraper.scrape_full_catalog(catalog_url)
```

### 3. **Key CTCLink Challenges**
- **College navigation**: Automatically finds and clicks Olympic College link
- **iframes**: Most content is in `main_iframe`
- **Dynamic loading**: Content loads via JavaScript
- **Form interactions**: Need to select subjects/terms
- **Session management**: May require login for full access
- **Debugging**: Screenshots automatically saved at key steps

## üìä Data Output

Both scrapers output data in multiple formats:

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "course_code": "CS 101",
  "course_title": "Introduction to Computer Science",
  "credits": "3",
  "instructor": "Dr. Smith",
  "schedule": "MWF 10:00-11:00",
  "location": "Room 101",
  "raw_text": "...",
  "extracted_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00"
}
```

### CSV Format
Suitable for Excel analysis and database import.

## üîß Configuration Options

### Selenium Scraper Options
```python
scraper = CourseScraperCTCLink(
    headless=True,        # Run without browser window
    wait_timeout=10       # Max wait time for elements
)
```

### Playwright Scraper Options
```python
scraper = CourseScraperPlaywright(
    headless=True         # Run without browser window
)
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Chrome driver not found"
**Solution:** 
- Install Chrome browser
- Selenium 4+ includes automatic driver management
- Or manually install: `pip install webdriver-manager`

### Issue: "No course data found"
**Solutions:**
1. Set `headless=False` to see what's happening
2. Check if login is required
3. Verify the iframe is being accessed
4. Check for CAPTCHA or bot detection

### Issue: "Timeout waiting for elements"
**Solutions:**
1. Increase `wait_timeout` parameter
2. Check internet connection
3. Verify the site is accessible
4. The site might be blocking automated access

### Issue: "Import errors"
**Solution:** Run the setup script:
```bash
# Windows
setup_scraper.bat

# Linux/Mac  
./setup_scraper.sh
```

## üéØ Customization for Specific Sites

### For Different CTCLink Instances
```python
# Modify these selectors in the scraper:
SUBJECT_SELECTOR = "select[name*='subject']"  # Adjust as needed
SEARCH_BUTTON = "input[type='submit']"        # Adjust as needed
IFRAME_NAME = "main_iframe"                   # May vary by site
```

### For Non-CTCLink Sites
1. Run `analyze_catalog.py` first
2. Modify selectors based on the site's HTML structure
3. Adjust the navigation flow in `scrape_full_catalog()`

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Use headless mode** for production: `headless=True`
2. **Limit subjects** for testing: `subjects[:5]` 
3. **Add delays** between requests: `time.sleep(2)`
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with try/catch blocks
5. **Save progress periodically** for long scraping sessions

## üîç Debugging Tips

1. **Set headless=False** to watch the browser
2. **Check logs** in `course_scraper.log`
3. **Review auto-screenshots** - saved automatically at key steps:
   - `01_page_loaded.png` - Initial page load
   - `02_olympic_college_page.png` - After clicking Olympic College link
   - `03_inside_iframe.png` - After switching to iframe
   - `04_search_results_[SUBJECT].png` - Search results for each subject
   - `05_scraping_complete.png` - Final state
4. **Use browser dev tools** to inspect elements
5. **Test with a single subject** first

## üìã Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Respect robots.txt** and site terms of service
- **Add delays** between requests to avoid overloading servers
- **Consider contacting** the site administrator for API access
- **Check if data is publicly available** through other means
- **Use scraped data responsibly** and according to applicable laws
